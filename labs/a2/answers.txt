Compiling and packaging

1. Will we still be able to run “hellopenguin” from any directory if we packaged it into “/usr/share” instead of “/usr/bin”?

Not unless /usr/share is in PATH

2. What is your rationale for the previous answer?

Typically executables are in bin directories, which are typically in the PATH environment variable.
Installing binaries in random directories would be tedious, requiring us to maintain an ever growing PATH.

Debugging

1. What package was missing after trying to install ocfspy?

2. What is the password that ocfspy outputs after fixing the dependency problem?


The password is Sinkhole.
