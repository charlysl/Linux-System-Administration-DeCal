Installing arch in my desktop using VMWare and Ubuntu 18.04 desktop failed early (no network called default)
Installing in Digital Ocean in a Ubuntu 18.04 server droplet failed as well (boots into the UEFI Shell, no way out)
But installing it my laptop using VMWare and Ubunti 18.04 server, updated and upgraded, did get as far as login!

Hostname: archiso
ip address: 192.168.122.104
Can't ping it from a host terminal


The purpose of having:

(1) the EFI system partition 

It is recommended that for compability this boot partition fs should be FAT32 (to support dual booting with Windows); however, the recommended fs for modern Linux is ext4, so the boot fs and the root fs should be installed on different partitions.

(2) the swap partition

Swap permanent storage doesn't use a filesystem at all; one option is to store assign it its own partition; another is to just use a regular file in a regular partition, like the root partition.


What would be the name of the device file corresponding to the fourth partition on the second discovered storage device?

sdb4
