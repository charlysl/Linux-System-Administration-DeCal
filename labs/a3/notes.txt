networking:
To be able to have internet connection at all after installation, you need to install dhcpcd,
and after reboot do    dhcpcd <interface name, like ens2>

If you don't do this you will be stuck after reboot, unable to access the internet, and hence to install packages (including dhcpcd!).

First time I came accross this problem I tried to get the archvm to read the dhcpcd package from an iso through a "cdrom", but this would have required a reboot to work (see below), so I just added the dhcpcd package to the installation the second time around.


packages:
I also included dhcpcd and ip

Snapshots:
I wanted to create a snapshot right before arch-chroot, because if I have to reinstall, this could save me a lot of time, like 1 hour.

To edit a vm's config file, run   virsh edit <vm name>

However, it seems like this is something I have to do before running the vm, won't read the config change on the fly.
